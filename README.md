# Rubik's Cube Implementation with OpenGL
 By: Eileen Apaza && Gabriel Valdivia

## Description:
This repository contains a comprehensive implementation of a Rubik's Cube using C++ and OpenGL. The project features a fully functional main animation and additional similar ones.
 

The first image depicts our assembled cube. When executed, it displays the assembled Rubik's Cube.

We apply movements to disarrange our cube and then proceed to apply the solver to it

Finally, we apply the solver to our Rubik's Cube. Movements are crucial as we'll store them to pass to the solver, allowing it to understand the current state of our cube. In the terminal, it will display the necessary movements to solve the Rubik's Cube.
